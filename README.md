## Commander Keen:  ReactJS Edition

### Background

Chip's Challenge is a classic tile-based puzzle game originally published by Epyx, and was later included in the Windows 3.1 Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4. The original Chips Challenge is a 1-player game that plays out on a grid.  Each grid item can be either chip, a key, a block, a door, or a wall.  There are also special items.
Chip's goal is to find the keys to unlock doors, and must move blocks in order to gain access to keys.

As a turn-based, tile-based game, a Chip's Challenge clone with Commander Keen sprites makes an ideal ReactJS candidate. By leveraging ReactJS's underlying Render logic, I can quickly write ChipJS by simply managing state of my underlying components! I want to show how React components can enable dry, well-organized code, and picked a game that favors a great deal of object-oriented programming.  Additionally, as an aspiring front-end developer who loves writing React, demonstrating a very strong understanding of ReactJS beyond my original fullstack project will help convince recruiters I have a solid understanding of React and Redux fundamentals and and have solid CSS skills that can flex well beyond traditional web applications. Lastly, by avoiding any game libraries and using a general framework like React, I can demonstrate that I fully and deeply understand everything it took to create the game.
