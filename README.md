# Commander Keen: ReactJS Edition
[Live Site](http://commanderkeen.io)


### Background

Chip's Challenge is a classic tile-based puzzle game originally published by Epyx, and was later included in the Windows 3.1 Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4. The original Chips Challenge is a 1-player game that plays out on a grid.  Each grid item can be either chip, a key, a block, a door, or a wall.  There are also special items.
Chip's goal is to find the keys to unlock doors, and must move blocks in order to gain access to keys.

### Why React and a Puzzle Game?

As a turn-based, tile-based game, a Chip's Challenge clone with Commander Keen sprites makes an ideal React candidate. By leveraging React's underlying Render logic, I can render new board states by simply managing the state of my underlying components.

I want to show how React components can enable dry, well-organized code, and picked a game that favors a great deal of object-oriented programming.  Lastly, by avoiding any game libraries whatsoever and using a general framework like React, I can demonstrate that I deeply understand the capabilities of React.
